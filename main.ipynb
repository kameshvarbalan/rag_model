    "The AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine was developed to prevent COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was previously known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or AZD1222. The ChAdOx1 viral vector was created at the University of Oxford and was also studied for use in vaccines against another coronavirus, MERS-CoV. The vaccine was produced through a partnership between the University of Oxford Jenner Institute and the Italian pharmaceutical company Advent Srl.\n",
    "This vaccine contains a replication-deficient adenovirus that can produce the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. This allows the body to make antibodies and an immune response against the virus. In May 2020, the University of Oxford made a development and distribution deal with AstraZeneca. The vaccine was later approved and used in many countries, including Canada, Mexico, the UK, the EU, and Australia.\n",
    "In March 2021, some EU countries temporarily stopped using the vaccine due to reports of blood clots with low platelet counts. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed these cases and found no increase in the overall risk of blood clots from the vaccine. However, it noted that very rare cases of blood clots with thrombocytopenia might be linked to the vaccine. The EMA stated that a causal link was possible but unproven, and it concluded that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks.\n",
    "A phase I/II clinical trial began in April 2020 in the UK to study the vaccine safety, efficacy, and immune response. It was a single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years. The vaccine is given as an intramuscular injection and is approved for use in adults aged 18 years and older.\n",
    "The AstraZeneca vaccine is given in two doses, spaced 4 to 12 weeks apart. Its overall efficacy in preventing COVID-19 is about 67%, and it is 100 percent effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Studies suggested that longer intervals between doses—12 weeks or more—might improve efficacy to around 80%, although this finding is still under review.\n",
    "In November 2021, Health Canada issued a warning about a rare risk of immune thrombocytopenia after vaccination. People were advised to seek medical help if they experienced unusual bleeding, bruising, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain or swelling, or persistent abdominal pain after receiving the vaccine.\n",
    "The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus vector called ChAdOx1. This vector carries the genetic instructions for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its pre-fusion form. After injection, the spike protein is produced in the body, triggering the immune system to create antibodies and immune cells that recognize and fight the virus. This immune response provides protection against future infection.\n",

The vaccine was developed through a collaboration between Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n",
    "Preclinical studies in animals showed promising results. In hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, a single dose of the vaccine triggered neutralizing antibodies and protected against pneumonia and death caused by the virus. Further studies in rhesus monkeys showed that the Ad26 vaccine produced a strong immune response and provided near-complete protection, as seen in nasal and lung samples taken after exposure to the virus.\n",
    "In June 2020, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial was launched to test the vaccine safety, immune response, and effectiveness in humans. The trial included 1,045 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55. The vaccine later received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States.\n",
    "The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is indicated for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in adults aged 18 years and older. In the U.S., it is authorized under an EUA for individuals 18 years or older who either do not have access to, or are not medically suited for, other FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines. It is also available to those who choose to receive it because they would otherwise not get vaccinated.\n",
    "The Janssen vaccine uses a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector. This vector carries the genetic code for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a stabilized form. After vaccination, the body cells produce the spike protein, which triggers the immune system to create antibodies and activate immune cells against it.
